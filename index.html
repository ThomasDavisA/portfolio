                With an interest in programming for most of my life, I build things when I code.  I enjoy connecting with people and working together with others to create things.  I enjoy travelling the US, having lived in multiple states, and I am willing to go wherever life takes me.  I find it exciting to meet new people and see new things.

                        Dragon Hoard is a project I am currently working on using the SAMMI program.  Users are able to connect to the Twitch API and use their channel points to give a coin to a growing pile of coins that are tracked over the course of several streams.  Dragon Hoard tracks not only the coins that have been given, divided into multiple rarities, but also tracks each person and what they have given to the hoard as well.  They are also able to accrue their own custom portrait when giving a coin to display themselves on the stream.

                        Cursr is a 'vent' app targeted toward adults and is meant to be used when a user is angry.  I lead a team of developers in designing and implementing this simple yet powerful app, letting users curse into a void, where others will get to read these messages and send back a 'blessing', all of it completely anonymous.  I largely handled styling and product management, keeping the team on task and on track in our three week period together.  The idea came about when I was frustrated and could not simply vent it out.

                        Trying to learn a new language?  This spaced repetition app was developed with me and two others using React and Node, while handling new data structures, and is targeted toward adults looking to learn a new language.  We were able to get voice functionality as well as multiple-choice questions put into the App, all the while giving it a very calm and easy style for people to feel comfortable with.  We wanted to build an app that lets users, as well as myself, learn a new language and to get comfortable with new vocabulary.

                        Time for an adventure! Kobold Adventures is a full-stack application I made for my first capstone app at Thinkful. This game was created for bite-sized text adventures for people on the go, with each adventure only taking 2-3 minutes total. I developed this game because I wanted a game I could play for small amounts of time as well. The technical challenges were significant, but I was able to combine all of my skills up to this point to create a program that works and can be played.

                        Wake the dragon! An incremental game I made before joining the Thinkful immersion program, using
                        JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. Kobold Cave is a game where you manage kobolds to make a platinum
                        coin. Made for people who enjoyed playing casual games, Kobold Cave blossomed into rudimentary
                        AI for the kobolds. Perfect for learning and to just spend an hour on, I learned how to handle
                        many objects and fundamental logic with Kobold Cave.
